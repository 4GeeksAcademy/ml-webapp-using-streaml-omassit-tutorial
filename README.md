# Machine learning web app using Streamlit
<!-- endhide -->

- In this project we will create a new web app, working again with the same model: predicting Titanic survival, but this time we will do it with python scripts using our new Streamlit skills! 

>Don't forget to always be resourceful!

## 🌱  How to start this project

You will not be forking this time, please take some time to read this instructions:

1. Create a new repository based on [machine learning project](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-python-template/generate) by [clicking here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-python-template).
2. Open the recently created repostiroy on Gitpod by using the [Gitpod button extension](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension/).
3. Once Gitpod VSCode has finished opening you start your project following the Instructions below.

## 🚛 How to deliver this project

Once you are finished deploying your streamlit app, make sure to commit your changes, push to your repository and go to 4Geeks.com to deliver and upload the web application link.

## 📝 Instructions

**Step 1:**

Now that you have learned what your final structure should look like, add the necessary files to the current project folder in order to have the correct structure, and edit the necessary ones.

**Step 2:**

Again, we will use the Titanic model (your .pkl file) to create a web application that after inserting some passenger features into the form, it predicts if that passenger would survive or not. This time show your Streamlit new skills to make a beautiful web app.

**Step 3:**

Deploy your app to Heroku!

> Use your [Deploy model using Streamlit and Heroku](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/machine-learning-content/blob/master/07-1d-ml_deploy/deploy-model-using-streamlit-and-heroku.md) lesson to guide you on every step.
